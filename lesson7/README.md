# Lesson 7: Collections

This lesson covers Rust's collection types: vectors, strings, and hash maps.

## Concepts Covered

- Vectors (`Vec<T>`): Growable arrays
- Strings: UTF-8 encoded text
- Hash maps (`HashMap<K, V>`): Key-value storage
- Iterating over collections
- Updating collections

## Running the Lesson

1. Navigate to the `lesson7` directory:

   ```bash
   cd lesson7
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./run_lesson7.sh
   ```

## Expected Output

The program demonstrates various operations on vectors, strings, and hash maps, including creation, modification, iteration, and word counting.

## Key Takeaways

- Vectors store multiple values of the same type
- Strings are collections of bytes representing UTF-8 text
- Hash maps store key-value pairs
- Use indexing for direct access, iteration for processing all elements
- Collections can be mutable or immutable
