## Getting Started

See [Lesson 1](lesson1/README.md) for Rust installation instructions and your first program.

## Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (rustc, cargo) installed via rustup
- Basic command line knowledge

## Running Lessons

Each lesson folder contains:

- Source code (.rs files)
- A README.md with detailed explanations
- A run script (run_lessonX.sh) for convenience

Navigate to a lesson folder and follow the instructions in its README.md.
